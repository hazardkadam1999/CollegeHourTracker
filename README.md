The app reads the information of student i.e., PRN. Then it gets information from Database and sends the SMS to pre-stored parent’s mobile no. The SMS is sent with the help of Messaging API .Here the time and date maintained by using a System Clock. So finally the parent gets the information about their children’s attendance.

It eliminates the human error that are likely to creep in the kind of working in which a bulk quantity of data and steps as to be performed. The system results in quick retrieval of information that is very vital for the progress any organization. Cost is minimized in case of registers.
